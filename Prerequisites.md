# Lesson 1: Intro to Gen-AI

## What is Gen-AI
This term is made of two things. Generative & AI.
Generative : creating new content such as Images, Text & Videos etc.
Artificial Inteligence: A Branch of computer science that deals with making computers and machines smart enough so that they can behave like humans. Ex Understandimng language, recognize objects and patterns.
When this AI starts generating new content, its called GenAI. 

## Why the hype now?
Conbination of 3 things Hardware, Software & Data.

## Graphics Processing Unit 
GPU is group of workers in a factory and CPU is like the CEO. 
CPU: is a Generalist, Performs complex tasks and Decision making, works on one job at a time. 
GPU: Great at simpler repetitive tasks, can work on many tasks at the same time. Has thiusand of samaller cores to handle tasks. handles multiple tasks at once.
recall the video of single paint ball vs paint ball canon.

## How is Machine Learning and AI are releated?
Machine learning is a subset/type of AI that focus on building systems that learns from Data and Behaves like Humans. Its is a program or system that trains a model from input data, that trained model can make useful prediction from new or never before seen data drawn from the same one used to train the model. Gives the computer the ability to learn without explicit programming. Two types; Supervised & Unsupervised.

## What are Machine learning and Models? 
Machine learning is a field of study, think of it as a process, and models are specific outputs of this model. This is what gets created after getting trained on the data. contains the knowldge and patterns learned from its training. 

## Deep Learning ?
Deep learning is a type of Machine learning that uses artificial nueral networks.
