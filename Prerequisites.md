# Lesson 1: Intro to Gen-AI

## What is Gen-AI
This term is made of two things. Generative & AI.
Generative : creating new content such as Images, Text & Videos etc.
Artificial Inteligence: A Branch of computer science that deals with making computers and machines smart enough so that they can behave like humans. Ex Understandimng language, recognize objects and patterns.
When this AI starts generating new content, its called GenAI. 

## Why the hype now?
Conbination of 3 things Hardware, Software & Data.

## Graphics Processing Unit 
GPU is group of workers in a factory and CPU is like the CEO. 
CPU: is a Generalist, Performs complex tasks and Decision making, works on one job at a time. 
GPU: Great at simpler repetitive tasks, can work on many tasks at the same time. Has thiusand of samaller cores to handle tasks. handles multiple tasks at once.
recall the video of single paint ball vs paint ball canon.

## How is Machine Learning and AI are releated?
Machine learning is a subset/type of AI that focus on building systems that learns from Data and Behaves like Humans. Its is a program or system that trains a model from input data, that trained model can make useful prediction from new or never before seen data drawn from the same one used to train the model. Gives the computer the ability to learn without explicit programming. Two types; Supervised & Unsupervised.

## What are Machine learning and Models? 
Machine learning is a field of study, think of it as a process, and models are specific outputs of this model. This is what gets created after getting trained on the data. contains the knowldge and patterns learned from its training. 

## Deep Learning ?
Deep learning is a type of Machine learning that uses artificial nueral networks.

## Artifical Neural Networks
are inspired by human brains. Made up of interconnected nodes called nuerons. Learn to process data and makes predictions. Deep learning has more layers of nuerons that allows them to predict better that traditional ML models. Neural networks can be both labelled and unlabelled data. This is called semi-supervised learning. insupervised learning a Neural n/w is trained on a small labelled data and allowed to generalise from a large unlabelled data. 

## Gen-AI 
is a type of Deep Learning which uses these artifical neural networks and can also process labelled as well as unlabelled data. to generate new content. 

## Large Language Models
is a type of deep learning models

Deep Learning 

Based on the output machine learning models can be divided into 2 types: Generative & Discriminative 

### Discriminative Model 
is used to classify or predict labels or Data points. e.g if a mail is SPAM or NOT SPAM here spam is the lable and mauil is the data point.
Discriminative models are typically trained on a dataset of these labelled data points. while learing the model is given labelled SAPM or NOT SPAM.
e.g Blood Reports to to a particular dicease or not.

### Generative Model
is used to designed to understand and reproduce the charistrics of data rather than distingushing between differrent categories or labels. 
if a model is trained on cat images then the model learns Shapes, Colors, patters, textures common to cat. it understand these features to create new images of cat that looks realistic but do not recreate any specific cat from training data. 
LLMs are a specific type of Generative models Focussing on the Language and GPT is a example of LLM.
