# Finetuning & LoRAs
Low Rank Adapters

#### Finetuning 
is the common practice pf taking a model which has been trained on a wide and diverse dataset, and then training it a bit more on the dataset you are specifically interested in.
This is a common practice on deep ;earning and has been shown to be tremendously effective all manner of models from standard image classification networks to GANs.

In this example we'll show how to fine tune Stable Diffucsion on a Pokemon dataset to create a text to image model which makes custom pokemon based on any text prompt.
