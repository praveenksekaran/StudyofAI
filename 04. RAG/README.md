# Different types of RAG techniqies
there are many many types of RAG techniques. only few few are tried in this project. 

## 1. Standard RAG 
combines 2 RAG concepts. a retrival model (search engine) and a generative model (like GTP).
Good : when you need to retive factual information from external source, while would like to maintain creativity of Gen AI . 
Examples: Customer support chat bot. 

## 2. Corrective RAG
in addition to Standard RAG, adds a validation process to make generated response is not just fluent but also factually correct. 
After the initial retrival & generation, the optput is cross check with trusted data set.
e.g. in medical applications the response might be validated aganist medical papaers or clinical guidlines. if any discrepency or inaccuries are foiund, the model corrects them before presenting it. 
Examples: Ideal for Healthcare or legal research where accuracy is paramount, reducing the risk of misInformation

## 3. Speculative RAG 
Explorative approach. Imagine a question with multiple possible interpretation, Speculative RAG generates multiple possible responses. Then ranks them based on relavence and accuracy. 
The model first retrives the relavent documents, then speculates by generating several possible answers, each of the answers is scored using feedback mechanism which could involve comparing thme to additioanl regtruived documents or using a scoring model to determine which is more relavent. once the higest scoring answer is identified, its presented as final anaswer. This type is particualrly useful for ambigious queries situations where there can be multiple correct answers.
Examples: Asking for recomendations or exploring complex topics whith many possible interpretations.

## 4. Fusion RAG
integrating information from multiple sources. is technique is designed for well rounded comprehensive response by combining data from various different documents. in fusion rag the system retrives multiple documents that offers multiple perspectives or cover various aspects of the query, the generative model then sysnthesis this information merging relavatent points of the query into unified response. if there is conflicting information the model resolves by considering additioanl context or the credibility of the sources.
Example: if you are asking about best programming language in 2025, fusing RAG will pull daat from various sources: Blog, posts, Job portals etc. and genrates a balance response which considers all these perspectives.

## 5. Agentic RAG
In this technique involves AI acting autonmously, with a specific goal in mind, retriving information and making decisions on its own to achieve desired outcome. 
first, the model is given a specific goal like explaining a complex concept or solving a problem, it then automously plans its actions, deciding which information to retrieve and how to use it achieve the goal. The model iterates this process, refining its understanding and actions dynamically. adjusting its strategy with the feedback it gets during the task. 
Example: AI tutor to explain quantam mechanics - Agentic RAG will automomously plan series of steps, retrieve relavent academic papaers or tutorials, breakdown the information, and guide you thru the explanation step by step.

## 6. Self RAG
Innovative technique allows the model to improve itself overtime by using its own outputs as new datapoints for future retrival. in Self RAG, AI starts by retriving information and generating response like usual, it stores it own generated response in dedicated repository. next time similar query comes up, the model retrives not just from origunal corpus but also from its previous outputs alloing it to build upon its past knowldge. over time self RAG, enables the model to continously refine its answers learning from its own innovations. this makes it powerful in scnerios whnere the model can benefit from continous learning such as customer service bots, personalized tutoring system

## 1. Data collection
first gather all the data that is needed for your application. In the case of a customer support chatbot for an electronics company, this can include user manuals, a product database, and a list of FAQs.

## 2. Indexing 

#### 2.a Data Chunking
Data chunking is the process of breaking your data down into smaller, more manageable pieces. For instance, if you have a lengthy 100-page user manual, you might break it down into different sections, each potentially answering different customer questions.
This way, each chunk of data is focused on a specific topic. When a piece of information is retrieved from the source dataset, it is more likely to be directly applicable to the user’s query, since we avoid including irrelevant information from entire documents.
This also improves efficiency, since the system can quickly obtain the most relevant pieces of information instead of processing entire documents.

check SematicChunking for different chunking methods and Standard for basic ones. 

#### 2.b Document embeddings
Now that the source data has been broken down into smaller parts, it needs to be converted into a vector representation. This involves transforming text data into embeddings, which are numeric representations that capture the semantic meaning behind text.

In simple words, document embeddings allow the system to understand user queries and match them with relevant information in the source dataset based on the meaning of the text, instead of a simple word-to-word comparison. This method ensures that the responses are relevant and aligned with the user’s query.

#### 2.c Key Concepts

**Vector DB**
- how you make a vector database from your domain-specific, proprietary data. To create your vector database, you convert your data into vectors by running it through an embedding model.
**embedding model** 
- An embedding model is a type of LLM that converts data into vectors: arrays, or groups, of numbers. In the above example, we’re converting user manuals containing the ground truth for operating the latest Volvo vehicle, but your data could be text, images, video, or audio.

## 3. Retrieval
When a user query enters the system, it must also be converted into an embedding or vector representation. The same model must be used for both the document and query embedding to ensure uniformity between the two.
Once the query is converted into an embedding, the system compares the query embedding with the document embeddings. It identifies and retrieves chunks whose embeddings are most similar to the query embedding, using measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.
These chunks are considered to be the most relevant to the user’s query.

### 3.a Keyword Search
Search for keyword in embeddings. check llamaidex example 

### 3.b Semantic Search
All examples implements this. the o/p depends on storing and retival strategy. 

### 3.c Filtering
use llamaIndex lib for storing and filtering s=using metadata.

### 3.d ReRanking
<toDo>

### 3.e cosine similarity
<todo>

## 4.Generation
The retrieved text chunks, along with the initial user query, are fed into a language model. The algorithm will use this information to generate a coherent response to the user’s questions through a chat interface.

## 5.Testing 

#### Manual testing 
Quesions and grounding truth was created manually and evaluated. 

- [project](https://github.com/praveenksekaran/RAG/blob/main/src/01_01_RAG_Standard.ipynb)

#### Ragas
Testing using ragas framework can be performed very easily. ragas is a open source framework which can generate test data and run test aganist it.
In this project 4 metrics were tested faithfulness, answer_relevancy,context_precision and context_recall

- [ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/howtos/)
- [project](https://github.com/praveenksekaran/RAG/blob/main/src/RAG_Testing_RAGAS.ipynb)

- Faithfulness
  (is the answer avaliable in the retrived data)
The Faithfulness metric measures how factually consistent a response is with the retrieved context. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better consistency.A response is considered faithful if all its claims can be supported by the retrieved context.
To calculate this:
  1. Identify all the claims in the response.
  2. Check each claim to see if it can be inferred from the retrieved context.

- Response Relevancy
  (how close the answer to ground truth)
  The ResponseRelevancy metric measures how relevant a response is to the user input. Higher scores indicate better alignment with the user input, while lower scores are given if the response is incomplete or includes redundant information.
  This metric is calculated using the user_input and the response as follows:
  1. Generate a set of artificial questions (default is 3) based on the response. These questions are designed to reflect the content of the response
  2. Compute the cosine similarity between the embedding of the user input (Eo) and the embedding of each generated question (Eg).
  3. Take the average of these cosine similarity scores to get the Answer Relevancy:

     Note: While the score usually falls between 0 and 1, it is not guaranteed due to cosine similarity's mathematical range of -1 to 1.

     An answer is considered relevant if it directly and appropriately addresses the original question. This metric focuses on how well the answer matches the intent of the question, without evaluating factual accuracy. It penalizes answers that are incomplete or include unnecessary details.

- Context Precision
  Context Precision is a metric that measures the proportion of relevant chunks in the retrieved_contexts. It is calculated as the mean of the precision@k for each chunk in the context. Precision@k is the ratio of the number of relevant chunks at rank k to the total number of chunks at rank k.

- Context Recall
  Context Recall measures how many of the relevant documents (or pieces of information) were successfully retrieved. It focuses on not missing important results. Higher recall means fewer relevant documents were left out. In short, recall is about not missing anything important. Since it is about not missing anything, calculating context recall always requires a reference to compare against.
